The Fun Facts Treehouse app as a Google Now card

I started the Treehouse Android Development track and the first project was a simple app that showed a new fact from an array of facts when a button was pressed at the bottom. I figured it would be interesting to recreate this on the web with javascript. The app was so simple that I decided to make it resemble a Google Now card. I used bootstrap to get in a little practice, and tried substituting zepto.js for jquery.js. It worked!
